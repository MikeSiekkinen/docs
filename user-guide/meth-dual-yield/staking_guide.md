# Stake

{% hint style="info" %}
This section covers staking LP tokens on [mETH](https://eth.mirror.finance).   
Staking guide for Mirror Web App is available [here](../getting-started/stake.md).
{% endhint %}

Users can stake mAsset-UST LP or MIR-UST LP tokens to earn MIR reward. 

Each staking position is unique to each type of LP tokens specified by the mAsset-UST pair. Also, due to different `weight` and pool price of each mAsset, each farming position has a different Annual Percentage Rate \(APR\), which represents the yearly MIR reward from staking LP tokens.

## Stake / Unstake LP Tokens
