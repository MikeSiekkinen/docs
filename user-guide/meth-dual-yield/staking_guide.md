# Staking Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
This section covers staking LP tokens on mETH.mirror.finance. Staking guide for Mirror Web App is available [here](../getting-started/stake.md).
{% endhint %}

Users who hold wmAsset / wMIR-wUST LP tokens from providing liquidity on Uniswap may stake them to earn wMIR reward. 

Each staking position is unique to each type of LP tokens specified by the wmAsset-UST pair. Also, due to different `weight` and pool price of each wmAsset, each farming position has a different Annual Percentage Rate \(APR\), which represents the yearly wMIR reward from staking LP tokens.

## Stake / Unstake LP Tokens

1. Navigate to Stake page. The Stake page shows the following data:

* **Market information about wMIR tokens:** Information about wMIR price, 24 hour trading volume and supply are provided. 
* **Staking Positions**: Each LP staking pool is displayed in boxes below the market information. Each pool is identifiable based on the name of the associated wmAsset.

2. Select a staking pool by clicking a box. 

* A staking pool where the user has LP tokens already staked will show a `Staked` label on top of the box.
* A staking pool where the user has LP to stake will show a `Stakable` label on top of the box.
