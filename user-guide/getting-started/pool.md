# Pool

The **Pool** page displays operations related to liquidity provision for mAsset and MIR markets. In order to provide liquidity for Mirror assets, you need to supply equal value of the asset and UST. After depositing your assets into the pool, you receive [LP tokens](../../protocol/lp-token.md) which will allow you to reclaim your share of the pool.
