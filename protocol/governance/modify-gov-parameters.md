# Modify Gov Parameters

At the onset of the Mirror Protocol, the `Quorum`, `Threshold`, `Voting Period`, `Effective Delay`, `Expiration Period`, and `Proposal Deposit`have been pre-set as follows:

| Parameter | Current Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Quorum | 10% |
| Threshold | 50% |
| Voting Period | 201600 blocks |
| Effective Delay | 100800 blocks |
| Expiration Period | 14400 blocks |
| Proposal Deposit | 100 MIR |

For more specific information about each parameter, please refer to [**Modify Gov Parameters**](proposal-types.md#5-modify-governance-parameters).

When submitting a poll to change a governance parameter, at least one field must be entered. Note that multiple parameters may be changed in one poll as well. In the case that only one parameter is being proposed to be modified, all the other parameter fields should be kept blank.
